Whisper commands
First, locate to the folder where the audio source is. then, use the following prompt format:
>whisper --model 'x' --language en "filename_here"


Prompt breakdown:


>whisper
This is the initial command. Absolutely required.


--model
This will determine how much care the model takes on transcription. Note: larger model = longer wait time.
Options are (in size, small to large):
tiny.en
base.en
small.en
medium.en
large

Note: if transcribing a different language, remove the .en ending.


--language
This is not required for any models with .en endings. When using the large model, the process will be quicker if 'en' or other desired language is written. use prefix.

"filename_here"
this is the name of the file. copy and paste. .mp3, .wav, .mp4, and most other filetypes that include audio are supported.
