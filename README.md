# Whisper
This is an installation guide for Whisper AI transcription.
Python 3.9.9 must be installed on your computer. It is easiest if this is the only version of Python that is installed. Download here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-399/
When installing Python after download, you MUST select the option that says "PATH". If you do not, the pip command will not work, and the installation will not be able to process.
When Python has installed, open an elevated CLI and type, ```pip3 install setuptools-rust
pip3 install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git
```
